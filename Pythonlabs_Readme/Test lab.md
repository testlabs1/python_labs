## Overview

In this lab we will create a compute instance, install httpd server on it, attach block volume to it and install an app on the Block Volume
We will then create a second compute instance using the boot volume of the first compute instance and move the Block Volume to 
the second compute instance (with the app installed).
The goal of the lab is to demonstrate launching VCN, Compute Instance, using Boot volume of compute instance and 
how easy it is to move additional storage with applicatons/tools installed between compute instances

## Install httpd on compute instance and install an app on Block Volume

1. Switch to ssh session to compute install. Install httpd server, Enter Command:
```
sudo yum -y install httpd 
```
2. Configure Compute instance firewall, Enter commands:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp 
```
(Open port 80 on the firewall to allow http and https traffic).

**NOTE:** Despite the line wrapping, the --add-port flag has no spaces.
```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload 
```
(Reload the firewall to activate the rules).

3. Start httpd, Enter command:
```
sudo systemctl start httpd 
```

4. Enter commad lsblk to verify the Block volume storage is initialized. This could be sda, sdb or somethig else strting with 'sd'. In below example this volume is called sdb. Below screen shot shows a 1 TB volume though in this lab we have created a 50GB volume thus the size in your compute instance will be 50GB.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/OCI_Quick_Start001.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

**HINT:** The Name sdb is the block volume storage. This name could change for your specific attachment (i.e sdc)

5. To format the block volume, Enter Command: 

```            
sudo fdisk <DEVICE_PATH> -l 
```

**For example sudo fdisk /dev/sdb -l**   
Wait for formatting to complete

6. Create a file system on the block volume, Enter Command: 

```
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L datapartition <DEVICE_PATH> 
```         

This will create the file system on the entire disk. Enter y when prompted with 'Proceed anyway'

**NOTE:** For this lab we will not be creating additional partitions

7. Create a directory where the disk will be mounted,Enter commands:
```
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/www/html            
```

8. Mount the disk to the newly created directory,
Enter command:
```
sudo mount  /dev/<VOLUME_NAME>  /mnt/www/html
```

9. Verify /dev/<VOLUME_NAME> volume is now mounted to /mnt/www/html directory, Enter command 
```
lsblk 
```
(in this case the volume is called sdc)
